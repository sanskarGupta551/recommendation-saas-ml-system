# Flagship Portfolio Project [2025]: recommendation-saas-ml-system  
**“End-to-End, Enterprise-Ready Recommendation SaaS with Real Reddit Data”**  
This detailed STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) outline presents an enterprise-grade, full-stack ML portfolio project, integrating live Reddit API data, modular cloud/on-premise deployment, and production best practices.

## 1. **Situation**

Users increasingly require personalized and relevant content experiences in SaaS platforms, yet most academic ML recommendations lack production readiness, live feedback, or real-world data integration. Companies demand engineers who can build end-to-end, scalable, cloud-deployable recommenders from scratch—including UX, pipelines, robust APIs, CI/CD/MLOps, and easy environment transitions.

## 2. **Task**

**Objective:**  
Build a SaaS recommendation system platform that:
- Ingests live Reddit user/post data for continuous learning.
- Provides real-time, personalized recommendations (content, communities, users).
- Delivers dashboards for both end-users (recommendations, controls) and admins (analytics, feedback, model health).
- Offers modular, automated deployment scripts for on-premises and major clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure), with full Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
- Implements CI/CD, monitoring, model management, and seamless scaling in production.

## 3. **Actions**

### **A. Data Engineering & Ingestion**
- **Use Reddit API** (via PRAW/asyncpraw) to continuously fetch live posts/comments from targeted subreddits.
- **ETL Pipelines**: 
  - Clean, de-duplicate, and preprocess text data (NLTK, spaCy).
  - Feature generation (user history, subreddit activity, post metadata).
  - Store raw and processed data in a hybrid storage setup (PostgreSQL/NoSQL for on-prem; Cloud SQL/BigTable/DynamoDB for cloud).

### **B. Machine Learning & Recommendation Engine**
- **Model Options**: 
  - Collaborative filtering (implicit/explicit feedback), content-based, and hybrid models.
  - Batch and real-time (on-request) recommenders.
- **ML Frameworks**: 
  - Model prototyping in PyTorch/Scikit-learn.
  - Experiment tracking/versioning using MLflow or DVC.
  - Scheduled retraining pipeline using Airflow (on-prem) and Cloud Composer/Dataflow (cloud).
- **Feedback Loop**: 
  - Collect explicit (user rating, upvote/downvote) and implicit (click, dwell time) feedback via the dashboard, feeding models for online learning/adaptation.

### **C. API & Backend Development**
- **API Service**: 
  - Build RESTful endpoints using FastAPI for exposing recommendations, user profiles, feedback ingestion, and admin analytics.
- **Security**: 
  - OAuth2/JWT-based authentication for users and admins.
- **Data Management**: 
  - Use SQLModel/SQLAlchemy for resource access, role-based permissions.

### **D. Frontend, Dashboards, & UX**
- **User Dashboard**: 
  - Interactive React/Next.js app (or rapid build: Streamlit/Gradio) showing live recommendations, feedback forms, history, and controls.
- **Admin Panel**: 
  - Analytics on system health, usage metrics, model performance, top recommendations, retraining status.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Plotly, Dash, or React chart libraries to display time series, A/B test results, user engagement over time.

### **E. MLOps, DevOps, and Automation**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: 
  - Automate testing, linting, building, and multi-environment deployments via GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
- **Containerization**: 
  - Dockerize all app and model services with best practices for reproducibility.
- **Model Registry & Monitoring**: 
  - Use MLflow/Weights & Biases for model management, Prometheus/Grafana (on-prem) or managed cloud equivalents for monitoring.
- **Logging/Alerting**: 
  - Integrate request, error, drift, and latency logging; send alerts for failures and model decay.

### **F. Cloud/On-prem Deployment (IaC)**
- **On-premises**: 
  - Terraform scripts to provision VMs, storage, and orchestrate Docker Compose or local K8s (Minikube).
- **Cloud-specific**: 
  - AWS: Terraform modules for EKS, RDS, Cognito, Lambda setups.
  - GCP: Terraform for GKE, Cloud SQL, IAM setup, Pub/Sub pipelines.
  - Azure: Terraform for AKS, CosmosDB, managed identity.
- **One Command Deploy/Teardown**: 
  - Each environment supports single-command infra setup and destruction, with separate configuration/documentation.

## 4. **Results**

- **Production-grade Demo**:  
  Showcases live personalized recommendation with user/admin dashboards, enterprise cloud infrastructure, and a seamless, hybrid pipeline.
- **End-to-End ML & Engineering**:  
  Highlights skills from cloud engineering to API dev, UX, advanced ML, MLOps, feedback loops, and scaling.
- **Full Reproducibility**:  
  Anyone can spin up the system—locally or on cloud—in minutes via clearly documented Terraform scripts.
- **Recruiter Highlights**:  
  - Real, up-to-date Reddit data.
  - Modular pipeline for rapid experimentation.
  - Secure, multi-tenant SaaS features.
  - Included MLOps with versioning, monitoring, rollback, and retraining.
  - Flexible for demos, PoCs, and real-world business adaption.
